## Reflection (10%)
rubric={raw:10}

In this section, you should (as a group) critique your dashboard and point out what it does well, what its limitations are, and what are good future improvements and additions. 
In this section, you should also **clearly document** how you addressed the feedback (GitHub issues) you received from your peers and the TAs.
Point form is fine, but they need to be full sentences.
This section should not be more than 500 words.
The `reflection.md` should live in your GitHub.com repo.
This file should be worked on collaboratively and each team member should submit a link to the same file.


After going through peer and TA reviews it appears that our R app is most effective and easy to use. Some of the issues from the previous reflections still remain unresolved. Such as the speed of the app. We have to inform that it got worse compared to the app where we used Altair. The problem seems to be caused by our map plot. Because in order to form a map it has to plot every single data point based on latitude and longitude, it takes a lot of processing time. And Altair seems to do a better job in handling such a massive amount of data. And because of that we also had some issues deploying the app. One of the biggest issues is still lack of district population data, without it our app still struggles with answering some of the research questions, but unfortunately, the solution for this issue is out of our reach.  
As goes to improvements, we changed our default settings for both Python and R app. So it's easier to navigate and more intuitive. We also paid more attention to the design and layout of the R app compared to the Python one.  The app layout was chosen based on the feedback from peers and seems to be more effective than the one we had before. The design was improved as well, this time we played with colors and different color schemes. We did a little research as well to find out what trends in presentations and apps were popular in 2019 color-wise. That contributed to our bold choice of bright colors. We also made our paragraph with app and functionality introduction a little shorter, to encourage people to read it.
Overall the app is effective and relatively easy to use. Issues with speed still require future modifications.
